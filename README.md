### Design

#### Color Scheme
* The color of the scheme of the site was decided by using natural pink and coral colors as this was specifed by the designer herself.
* The colors of #ff7369 & #fcd4e6, were agreed with the designer. These colors complement  the main and overall color dervived from the app theme. This color is neutral and allows text to be easily read. 
* Where suitable the color black was used for text & buttons against the light background, these are contrasting colors that allow the user to easily read the information.
* With a neutral background color, the information depicted would not be too contrasting on the site when loaded. 

#### Typography
* The font utilised for this app was the Playfiar font. This font has the serif typeface, therefore Sans Serif will be used as the fallback font in case there is an issue when importing the fonts, or browsers not supporting these. Font was imported via Google Fonts completement the simplicity of the design giving a visually pleasing user experience. This again, was also agreed with the designer.

#### Imagery
* Images used purely for some asthetically pleasing design.  
* Font icons will be used throughout the website imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
  These will be used to further emphasise the different sections of the website. 
  Using these icons adds a simple, effective and a subtle touch to the site that allows the user to understand what each section relates to. 
  The icons will be relevant to the different section headings of the site.
