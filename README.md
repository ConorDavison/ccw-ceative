## User Design

### Strategy
* With the main goal for this app to allow users to simply purchase products created by the designer, aesthetically pleasing and relevant  imagery will allow the user to focus on the content, without being distracted. 
* The design of the site needs to complement the content it is delivering.
* The 'Home' page allows users to read a small consise text box describing the purpose of this app and some brief background of the designer. 
* This website is aimed at users who want potentially puchase any products or want to support a local independant desiger. 
  There is no pressure to purchase any items. Moreover, there are different products for different types of customers.
* The wishlist allows users to save items they are a fan of but do not want to order at that particular time. This encourages the user to maybe return in the future.

### Scope
* Responsive website for any viewing device size.
* Responsive and interactive navigation bar.
* Relevant images showing all products mentioned on the app and useful details accompanying the product when clicked.
* Producing and interactive website with clickable features that allow the user to find further information about the different products.
* Internal page links that allow the user to navigate the website efficiently.
* User authentication to enure that users have there own personal history of orders and ensure details saved.

#### Future Scope

### Structure

    * Simple title with navigation in header. This will be responsive and across all pages of website. With links to main section of site.
* Body - 
    * Main elements found here, depicting important information, relavant to the current page user is on.
    * There will be button elements that enable the user to navigate the content easily and simply.
    * Dependent on the page, there will be images with accompanying information for the user to discover.
    * Dependent on the page there will be an interative form allowing a user to submit requests and enquires for custom prints. 
* Footer - 
    * Copyright information stored here.
    * Some internal links may also be added here.


### Design

#### Color Scheme
* The color of the scheme of the site was decided by using natural pink and coral colors as this was specifed by the designer herself.
* The colors of #ff7369 & #fcd4e6, were agreed with the designer. These colors complement  the main and overall color dervived from the app theme. This color is neutral and allows text to be easily read. 
* Where suitable the color black was used for text & buttons against the light background, these are contrasting colors that allow the user to easily read the information.
* With a neutral background color, the information depicted would not be too contrasting on the site when loaded. 

#### Typography
* The font utilised for this app was the Playfiar font. This font has the serif typeface, therefore Sans Serif will be used as the fallback font in case there is an issue when importing the fonts, or browsers not supporting these. Font was imported via Google Fonts completement the simplicity of the design giving a visually pleasing user experience. This again, was also agreed with the designer.

#### Imagery
* Images used purely for some asthetically pleasing design.  
* Font icons will be used throughout the website imported from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
  These will be used to further emphasise the different sections of the website. 
  Using these icons adds a simple, effective and a subtle touch to the site that allows the user to understand what each section relates to. 
  The icons will be relevant to the different section headings of the site.

# Deployment
* For this I used Gitpod to deploy my project.

* First create a heroku account and create a app - The name is up to you: mine was ccwcreative. Select a region closest to you - mine was Europe

* This assumes you already have a Stripe account.

* In heroku, under resources tab > Add-ons, search for postgress and add it. Select Hobby-Dev. as your plan - should be free

* Go to settings and ensure there is a variable called "DATABASE_URL"
* Product data needs to be imported

* In the terminal type python3 manage.py loaddata categories.json followed by python3 manage.py loaddata products.json
* Products depend on categories so order is important
  create a super user

* In the terminal type python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  follow the prompt in the terminal to create the superuser
* Create a Procfile for heroku

* The context of the file should be web: gunicorn [Main app].wsgi:application - my main app is Gymshop
* In the terminal run heroku login -i and login to your heroku account through the terminal

* In settings.py > ALLOWED_HOSTS > add the heroku app URL and local host:

* ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['[heroku app name].herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
* Push code to Heroku - Note static files are not visible

* initialize a heroku repository if not done so already
* Instructions for this can be found under the Deploy tab in heroku
* Add and commit using git
* Then git push heroku master
* Set up automatic deploys in heroku

* Deploy tab > Deployment method > Github > Search for the repository > Enable automatic deploys > master branch
* Set up a AWS account and initialise S3

* Create a AWS account at amazon web services
* My Account > AWS management console > Look for S3 - under recently visited service, the search bar or the find services search bar
* Create bucket > Enter bucket name and region - name should be the same as heroku and region should be closest to you > Disable "Block  public access"
* Acknowledge the bucket is public > Create bucket > Click on the bucket's hyperlink > Properties tab
* Scroll down to Static Website Hosting > Edit > Static Website Hosting - enable > Hosting Type - Host a static website > Fill out default values > Save

        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
* Permissions tab > Bucket Policy > Edit > Policy Generator > a new tab will open
  * Policy Type: S3
  * Effect: Allow
  * Principal: 
  * Actions : GetObject*
  * ARN: paste from previous tab

* In the side Nav click Policies > Create Policy > JSON tab > Import managed Policy > search for: "AmazonS3FullAccess" > import
* Create a list ([]) at the resource value and paste the ARN twice and append /* to the end of the second ARN (both are strings so "" is needed and need to be comma separated)
  * ["ARN", "ARN/*"]
* Next: tags > Next: Review > provide name and description > Create Policy
* Side Nav, click on Groups > manage-operation-gym > Permissions tab > Attach Policy > search and select the policy that was created > Attach Policy

* Connect django to S3

   * In settings.py > change the following code:
     AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = '[your bucket name]'
     AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = '[your region]'

   * Go to heroku > Settings > Config Vars > Add the following config vars:
      * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - (value found in the CSV file)
      * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - (value found in the CSV file)
    * Rebuild the app and see the files appearing the S3 bucket
    * Go to the S3 bucket > Create folder > name it media > upload the content of the media file > Set ACL public access to "read" in the objects column

* Create email functionality

In Gmail (due to its simplicity) got to Settings > See all settings > Accounts and import > other Google account settings
A new tab will open. In the side nav, click Security > turn on 2 step verification > App Passwords
"Select the app and device you want to generate the app password for" : other
Add a custom name > Generate
A window will appear with a key. Do not close this window. Copy the key to your clipboard
In the config vars of the heroku app create 2 variables:
EMAIL_HOST_PASS: The key generated by Gmail
EMAIL_HOST_USER: your email address where the key was retrieved from
In Heroku Config vars add your variables:

DATABASE_URL - Should already by provided by Postgress
DEVELOPMENT - Boolean - False
SECRET_KEY - Provided by Django
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY - Provided by Stripe - "Publishable key" on Stripe dashboard
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - Provided by Stripe - "Secret key" on Stripe dashboard
STRIPE_WH_SECRET - Provided by Stripe - Developers > Webhooks > add an end point > select endpoint > Signing secret
log in to stripe Stripe > Side Nav, click Developers > Webhooks > add endpoint > the endpoint is [URL of deployed site]/checkout/wh/ > receive all events > add endpoint
Send a test webhook if this is successful. Sometimes it is slow to process this and a 401 error will appear but if you wait a few minutes it should work
Login to the deployed site's admin (/admin) with admin login details and then verify the admin account

Site is now fully deployed and is 100% functional

Offline/Local Deployment
In VSC , First clone the project from Github

 git clone https://github.com/KeisGSmit/Gymshop.git
Create a virtual environment in Windows. Navigate to where the project folder is and run:

     python -m venv venv
Activate the venv - Navigate to venv folder in the terminal window and inside run:

     C:\Python\Django_Project_Name\venv>Scripts\activate
If activation was successful, you should see the name of the virtual environment in curly braces in the front of the path:

      (venv) C:\Python\Django_Project_Name\venv>
Install packages needed for the project:

     (venv) C:\Python\Django_Project_Name> pip install requirements.txt
Create your superuser(admin)

     python manage.py createsuper
Run command:

     python manage.py makemigrations
Run command:

     python manage.py migrate
Create an env.py to store the env variables. The env variables needed for the project are: DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASS

You will need your own S3 bucket for storing media.

To generate a random key for SECRET_KEY, in CMD:

    >>>import secrets
    >>>secrets.token_hex(16)
    >>>'15412c9e3e3ff5e03cac2270cc6fb57f'
    >>>exit()
